# Hand Tracking and Drawing

This repository contains code for hand tracking and drawing using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. The program detects the index finger tip in real-time through a webcam feed and allows the user to draw continuous lines on the screen by moving their finger.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe.
- Continuous drawing motion based on the movement of the index finger tip.
- Start drawing by pressing the 'q' key and stop drawing by pressing any other key.
- Adjustable line thickness and color (currently set to blue color with a thickness of 5 pixels).
